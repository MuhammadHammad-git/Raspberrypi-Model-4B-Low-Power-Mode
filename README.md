# Raspberrypi Model 4B Low Power Mode
## This is a custom made Low Power Mode for Raspberry pi 4B. **This is work in Progress!**
- It caps CPU Frequencies to the lowest Possible Safe Frequencies of 600HZ.
- To decrease Power even further you can disable other CPUs hence allowing a single CPU to run only! _This code Assumes that_
- It Also uses some basic methods like disabling USB Bus to disabling LED interface to reduce Power!
- **_Please feel free to contribute_**
- **lets make a _Low Power Mode for Raspberry Pi_ a reality!**
